## WHY
This repo helps to export modern React web components to a single JS file that has all components loaded and is transpiled to a IE 11 compatible standards. This makes it possible to enjoy modern webdevelopment whilst catering to a legacy browser that is somehow still widely depolyed in enterprise environments.

## HOW TO SETUP
- Place all the js (and only js) in the input folder. 
- Make index.js the entry file i.e. the root of the React app and the root-source of all imports.

*The index.html and index.css are just there for illustration*

## HOW TO RUN
`npm run build`
