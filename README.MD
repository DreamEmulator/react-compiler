## HOW TO SETUP
- Place all the js (and only js) in the input folder. 
- Make index.js the entry file i.e. the root of the React app and the root-source of all imports.

*The index.html and index.css are just their for illustration*
*The original app is from a highly recommended Team-Treehouse course*

`npm run build`
